                      <h4>Jean Biography</h4>
                      <p>

Jean Toussaint was born to an African Carribean family from Martinique (mother) and Dominica
(father) on the Dutch Caribbean island of Aruba. A few years later the family moved to Dominica
and spent the next few years travelling back and forth between Martinique and Dominica before
settling in St. Thomas USVI. This move was incredibly important for Jean’s musical development
for it was the beginning of his exposure to Jazz. “I remember when I was in the 5th grade my
teacher, Mrs Ayalla taught the class the Gerswin classic Summer Time, and even though I didn’t
realise it at the time, this was the very first jazz standard that I would learn”. <br>

It wasn’t until he got to the 9th grade that Jean, who at the time was exploring his early passion
for drawing and painting, realised that music and learning to play an instrument was an option. <br>

“My best friend from elementary school, Daryl DeGraff, started to play the alto sax when we
entered the 9th grade, he showed me his instrument, which I instantly fell in love with. The shiny
lacquer, and the fact that there seemed to be more notes than we had fingers to play, was my first
attraction to the saxophone. And then I tried it and fell in love with the sound. But I was too late,
as all the available instruments had been taken, and spent my first year of high school in the choir
learning to sing, which I absolutely loved”. <br>

The following year, in the 10th grade, Jean was able to begin learning the saxophone as well, and
within 6 months had progressed to lead alto in the school band. His quick development was
noticed by the director of the marching/stage band Charles Cox and the head of music John
Crawford who did everything they could to nurture and encourage the talented youngster. Outside
of school, Jean started spending many hour practicing and playing to recordings. “My first
influences were Grover Washington Jr, Ronnie Laws, the Jazz Crusaders, Hubert Laws, Herbie
Hancock’s Head Hunters, Bob James and the funk, soul, calypso and reggae bands of my youth”. <br>

He also joined his first band. A popular calypso band known all over the Virgin Islands as
“Mandingo Brass” and, due to his great ears, quickly became the horn section arranger. With
Mandingo, Jean immersed himself in music and changed course from visual arts to music. <br>

With the help of John Jowers at the Virgin Islands Council of the Arts, after graduating high school
with honours, Jean was given financial aid to attend Berklee College of music in Boston. <br>

“When I got to Berklee I had only been playing for 3 years and had a lot of holes in my
instrumental and musical foundation. This meant that I was totally blown away by the technical
skills and musicianship of some of my classmates who had been playing for 10 or more years”. <br>

This made me envious, and I became determined to gain the level of facility demonstrated on a
daily basis by some of my peers. I started to practice all the available hours that I was allowed to
book a room, and when that was insufficient, started the trend of getting locked in deliberately
and practising through the night”.  <br>

This intense practice coupled with regular lessons from his first jazz mentor William “Billy” Pierce
saw Jean’s playing and understanding move in leaps and bonds which eventually led him, with
Billy’s guidance and encouragement, to an audition for the tenor chair in the legendary Art
Blakey’s Jazz Messengers. Fortunately, with help and encouragement from the band’s alto
saxophonist Donald Harrison and trumpeter Terence Blanchard, Jean made it through the audition
and joined the Messengers in August of 1982.  <br><br>

“With Art I really started to learn about the music from a historically, yet highly creative, point of
view. Art taught us through the music, he hardly ever verbalised what he was trying to teach. And I
found this to be the most effective way to learn. We were also required to compose and arrange
for the band which allowed us to hone those skills”.  <br><br>

Art Blakey thrusted his young charges onto the world’s stage and throughout his long and
illustrious career created more band leaders than any other band leader in the history of this
music.  <br><br>

Toussaint traveled the world with the Messengers. Europe east and west, Japan, Africa, Canada,
USA, South America and beyond. In a short while, Jean went from total obscurity to traveling the
world with one of the most popular bands in the history of the music.
Due to his Caribbean background, Jean identified with many of the young African European jazz
musicians, also of Caribbean background, that he met in London on his tours with the
Messengers. <br><br>

“This made it incredibly easy for me to transition into the Black British way of life when I decided
to explore my options”.  <br><br>

Some of the musicians Jean has, and continues to work with, are fantastic award winners like
composer/pianist/broadcaster Julian Joseph, composer/vocalist Cleveland Watkiss, composer/
vibraphonist Orphy Robinson, composer/saxophonist Steve Williamson, composer trombonist
Dennis Rollins, composer/trumpeter Byron Wallen, composer/saxophonist Jason Yarde,
composer/pianist the late Bheki Mseleku, pianist Jason Rebello and many others.
Toussaint has led many award wining projects over the years and has garnered many glowing
press reviews. Some of his accomplishments are as follows; <br><br>

“My new project is currently being prepared and the recording should begin next Spring (2022).
The project is a collection of compositions written or rearranged during the pandemic lockdown in
2020/21in tribute to my siblings, people and places important in my life. The finished work will be
called “Songs for Sisters, Brothers and others”. I am grateful for having received generous grants
from Help Musicians (MOBO Awards) and the PRS Foundation: Open Fund for Music Creators to
help us create this work and hope to be ready for release in the autumn of 2022 followed by an
extensive UK/European tour.</p>
